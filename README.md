To create a well-structured README for your project showcasing Redux and Redux Toolkit state management, here’s a template that you can use. This covers the basic aspects of Redux for managing the state in your shopping cart application.

# Redux Shopping Cart Application

This is a **Redux-based shopping cart** application built using **React**, **Redux**, and **Redux Toolkit**. The app demonstrates state management with Redux, allowing users to browse products, add them to a cart, and manage cart operations.

## Features

- View a list of products with pricing and rating details.
- Add or remove products from the shopping cart.
- Display total items in the cart.
- Products are displayed in a grid layout.
- Simple, clean design with responsive elements.

---

## Technologies Used

- **React** for UI components.
- **Redux** for global state management.
- **Redux Toolkit** for simplifying the Redux setup.
- **Sass** for styling.
- **Webpack** for bundling the application.
- **ESLint** for linting JavaScript code.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/redux-shopping-cart.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd redux-shopping-cart
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## How Redux is Used

### State Slice

Redux Toolkit is used to create slices that represent different parts of the state. In this shopping cart app, the cart state is managed using a `cartSlice`.

```js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'cart',
  initialState: {
    cartItems: [],
    totalAmount: 0,
  },
  reducers: {
    addItem: (state, action) => {
      // Logic to add items to the cart
    },
    removeItem: (state, action) => {
      // Logic to remove items from the cart
    },
  },
});

export const { addItem, removeItem } = cartSlice.actions;
export default cartSlice.reducer;
```

### Reducers & Actions

Actions like `addItem` and `removeItem` are dispatched when users interact with the cart. The reducers modify the state in response to these actions.

### Store

The store is configured using `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit. The `cartSlice.reducer` is combined into the store to manage the application’s state.

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import cartReducer from './slices/cartSlice';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    cart: cartReducer,
  },
});

export default store;
```

## Available Scripts

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
